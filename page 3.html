<h1>Why Jet Lis role as Danny the dog alongside Morgan </h1>
<img src="5.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; margin-right: 30px;">

<p>Luc Besson's gritty, Glasgow-set action film about a man raised as an attack dog must have seemed like a good chance for Jet Li to leave his mark on Hollywood
    The martial arts actor stood out even among his industry heavyweight co-stars, but the business of moviemaking ultimately took him back to China afterwards
    It is the unpredictable alchemy of the movies. Sometimes great talents come together from far and wide to make outstanding films; some-times the results stand out for all the wrong reasons. At least, as with the 2005 Jet Li film Unleashed, they're rarely boring.
    <br><br>
    Known elsewhere as Danny the Dog, Unleashed brings together an astonishing list of collaborators who give its familiar story beats of a new urgency.
    Written and produced by Luc Besson (The Fifth Element), and directed by Louis Leterrier (Fast X), both Frenchmen, the film stars Chinese martial arts icon Jet Li (Hero), Hollywood heavyweight Morgan Freeman (The Shawshank Redemption) and British national treasure Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?).

    Behind the scenes, Hong Kong legend Yuen Woo-ping (The Matrix) choreographed the fights, and the British trip-hop collective Massive Attack provided the sombre score.
    
    All this and it was shot in the post-industrial environs of Glasgow - all rain-lashed factories and dank back allies - not that you'll hear any Scottish accents.
