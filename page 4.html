Apple's new augmented reality headset, the $3,500 Vision Pro, is scarcely more than two weeks old — but early adopters are already testing the boundaries of where they can road test their new toy in polite society.
<br><br>
Social media has become deluged in posts catching mesmerized Vision Pro users engaging with their virtual environments in public and looking like futuristic mimes. 
<br><br>
While many of these videos have proven to be influencers doing stunts for clicks, Apple's big bet on its expensive, portable goggles means customers will be looking for every excuse to get their money's worth and flaunt their luxury tech splurge.
Or, as one Instagram user phrased it, 'Welcome to the era of the Vision Bro.' 
<br><br>

Safety information for Apple Vision Pro on the company's website, nevertheless, explicitly prohibits using the headset while driving regardless of intent.
<br><br>

'Never use Apple Vision Pro while operating a moving vehicle, bicycle, heavy machinery, or in any other situations requiring attention to safety,' the company said.
<br><br>

This didn't stop YouTuber Casey Neistat from skateboarding down a bus lane in downtown Manhattan while wearing the headset for his review — a stunt that earned him more than 4 million views in just 48 hours.
